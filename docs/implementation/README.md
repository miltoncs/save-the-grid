# Implementation Documentation

This folder is for engineering execution details that realize the design docs.

## Intended Contents

Add technical documentation here as implementation begins, for example:

- Architecture overview (runtime layers, modules, boundaries).
- Simulation loop and state model.
- Data schemas and persistence format.
- UI/state management architecture.
- Testing strategy and validation harnesses.
- Build, release, and operational runbooks.

## Scope Rules

Keep these docs focused on how the product is built:

- Include concrete technical decisions, interfaces, dependencies, and constraints.
- Link back to the corresponding design document in `../design/` that defines the player-facing intent.
- Avoid repeating full design rationale when a short cross-link is enough.
