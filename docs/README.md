# Save the Grid Documentation

This directory is organized into two documentation tracks:

- `design/`: game design and design philosophy.
- `implementation/`: engineering and delivery documentation.

## Quick Index

- `design/README.md`: Design doc index, scope, and ownership.
- `implementation/README.md`: Implementation doc index and technical doc conventions.

## Documentation Boundary

Use this rule when adding or updating docs:

- `design/` answers: what the player experience should be and why.
- `implementation/` answers: how systems are built, integrated, tested, and shipped.

If a document mixes both, split it into one design doc and one implementation doc that cross-link each other.
