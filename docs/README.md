# Energies Game Documentation

This folder contains the active design docs for the game concept.

## Documents

- `GAME_DESIGN.md`: Primary game design document (vision, loop, systems, and MVP scope).
- `FRONTEND_AND_UX.md`: Splash screen, main menu, HUD, and UI interaction model.
- `MISSION_AND_MODE_DESIGN.md`: Roguelike run mode, campaign mission structure, and custom game rules.
- `MAP_DESIGN_2D.md`: 2D overhead map structure, readability rules, and region/terrain behavior.
- `MULTIPLAYER_NOTES.md`: Singleplayer-first strategy and forward-looking multiplayer compatibility notes.

## Current Concept Status

- Mode focus: Singleplayer first.
- Run structure: Roguelike runs.
- Additional mode surfaces: Campaign mission chain + custom game setup.
- Meta progression: Cosmetic-only unlocks between runs.
- Runtime pacing: Strict real-time once a run starts (no pause or slow-motion).
- Story approach: Light, unobtrusive background storytelling.
- Simulation depth: Shallow and readable.
- Map perspective: 2D overhead.
