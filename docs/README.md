## Current Concept Status

- Mode focus: Singleplayer first.

- Meta progression: Cosmetic-only unlocks between runs.
- Runtime pacing: Real-time simulation with optional pause in singleplayer (no slow-motion).
- Story approach: Light, unobtrusive background storytelling.
- Simulation depth: Shallow and readable.
- Map perspective: 2D overhead.
- Map content strategy: Handcrafted maps in v1.
- Web-game principle: Easy to play, hard to master.
