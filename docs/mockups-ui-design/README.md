# Visual Mockups and UI Design

This folder is intentionally implementation-free.

It contains simple SVG mockups so we can discuss visual direction quickly without touching gameplay code or architecture.

## Mockups

- `mockup-main-menu.svg`: Main menu composition with a map preview and run-entry actions.
- `mockup-terrain-map.png`: Primary no-UI terrain map (water, fertile, dry, desert, ice) for gameplay background direction.
- `mockup-terrain-map.metadata.json`: Map metadata linked to the terrain PNG, including polygon-based natural resource zones in pixel coordinates.
- `mockup-gameplay-map-layer.svg`: Map-only layer focused on terrain, coastlines, rivers, boundaries, and grid geography.
- `mockup-gameplay-ui-layer.svg`: Transparent UI-only layer for HUD controls and status cards.
- `mockup-gameplay-hud.svg`: Combined composition (map layer + UI layer) for full-screen review.
- `mockup-gameplay-round-floating-ui.svg`: Full-screen in-round HUD concept with map edge-to-edge and Google-Maps-like floating controls only (no docked panels).
- `mockup-results-screen.svg`: End-of-run summary hierarchy (score, reliability, medals, action buttons).

## Current Visual Direction

- Tone: utility control room with clean neon accents.
- Palette: deep slate background, cyan/teal action colors, amber warning highlights.
- Layout: clear panel hierarchy with a large map-first center area.

## Iteration Notes

- Keep changes fast and visual-first.
- Prefer simple shapes and typography over detailed illustration.
- Add new concepts as extra SVG files instead of replacing old ones.
- For gameplay screen iteration, modify map and UI in their separate layer files first, then validate the combined file.
- The terrain PNG is generated by `generate_terrain_map_png.py` for quick color/shape iteration without external dependencies.
