# Design Documentation

This folder contains product intent, gameplay design, UX direction, and forward-looking multiplayer design constraints.

## Documents

- `GAME_DESIGN.md`: Core game vision, design pillars, systems boundaries, and MVP design scope.
- `FRONTEND_AND_UX.md`: UX flow, interface surfaces, HUD behavior, and readability/accessibility guidance.
- `MISSION_AND_MODE_DESIGN.md`: Standard run, campaign mission structure, and custom mode policy.
- `MAP_DESIGN_2D.md`: 2D map model, readability constraints, and map interaction rules.
- `MULTIPLAYER_NOTES.md`: Singleplayer-first multiplayer compatibility constraints for future phases.

## Scope Rules

Keep these docs focused on outcomes and player-facing behavior:

- Include design intent, constraints, and tradeoffs.
- Avoid implementation details like module names, class structures, API schemas, or deployment steps.
- When technical decisions are required, record the design intent here and link to the implementation document that executes it.
