# Runtime Data

This directory contains structured runtime metadata/content files consumed by the game.

## Layout

- `maps/terrain/`: terrain metadata and map-linked data payloads.

## Rule

Use this directory for JSON/data contracts.
Keep binary assets in `/assets` and generation tools in `/tools`.
