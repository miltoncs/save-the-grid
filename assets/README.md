# Runtime Assets

This directory contains static files served directly to the game at runtime.

## Layout

- `icons/`: SVG icon packs used in UI and map overlays.
- `maps/terrain/`: terrain PNG backgrounds and generated mission terrain images.
- `patterns/`: repeatable SVG pattern assets (for line/corridor visualization).

## Rule

Store only runtime-consumed static assets here.
Do not place design docs, tooling previews, or generation scripts in this directory.
